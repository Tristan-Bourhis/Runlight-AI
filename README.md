Here you will find one of my artificial intelligence projects made in Python

You will find a report in French of the project under the name of **Rapport_Runlight_***

The objective is to compare different AI models in order to be able to analyze the race of an athlete in order to be able to improve his performances with reduced costs.

The different models compared are a polynomial regression, an SVM model(support-vector machine) and a CNN model(machine learning neural network).
